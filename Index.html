        <p>My hobby is swimming,when I was 4 years old I did not know swimming but I still kep't practicing until one day I was with my friend in the swimming pool I learnt it by my self suddenly I got suprised then my father taught me how to float and helped me swim more. after few months I joined a class and I kep't practicing practicing. After few years, my school my swimming teacher encouraged me to swim I swam all the time after school I spent 2 hours with my coach practicing swimming and now I am very good in swimmming and my dream is to become a olyampic swimmer and win gold medal for India. </p>
